# 8-Puzzle-Solver
8 puzzle solver using informed and uninformed searches.

- Uninformed Searches: 
  - BFS
  - DFS
- Informed Searches:
  - Best-First
  - A-star algorithm

The informed searches can use any of the following heuristics:
- Hamming Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Permutaion Inversion
- Nilsson Sequence
